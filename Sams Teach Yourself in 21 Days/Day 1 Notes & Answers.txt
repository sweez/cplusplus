• The steps to develop a C++ program
• How to enter, compile, and link your first working C++ program

Note 1
{
	The word program is used in two ways: to describe individual instructions
	(or source code) created by the programmer, and to describe an entire piece of executable software. 
	This distinction can cause enormous confusion, so this book tries to distinguish between the source code, on one hand, and the executable, on the other.

Note 2:
Procedural, Structured, and Object-Oriented Programming

Procedural:

A set of specific instructions executed one after the other.


Structured:

The principal idea behind it is the idea of divide and conquer.
Basically it can be thought as a computer program consiting of a set of smaller tasks working together to accomplish a bigger task.

If you have a complex task then you can break it down into managable chunks.


Object-Oriented:

The essence of 'Object-Oriented' programming is to model 'objects'.
Basically it allows you to add properties and/or attributes, such as age, fast, spacious, black, or wet. 


.NET:

.NET is an extension to C++ provided by Microsoft. 
If you wish to use its advanced features you will have to extend your knowledge of standard C++ to include these extensions to the language.



The ANSI Standard:
Stands for American National Standards Institute and was made as an international standard for C++. 

The C++ Standard is also referred to as the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard.

It was made as an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable, making sure that the code you write for a Microsoft Compiler also works with any other compiler out there following the same standards.
