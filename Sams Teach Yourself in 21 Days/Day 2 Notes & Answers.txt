Day 2 Notes & Answers

Today, you will learn
• The parts of a C++ program
• How the parts work together
• What a function is and what it does


Notes:

Explained:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
	return 0;
}

# - The preprocessor

The preprocessor runs before your compiler each time the compiler is
invoked. The preprocessor translates any line that begins with a pound symbol (#) into a special command, getting your code file ready for the compiler.


#include - preprocessor instruction

The command #include tells the compiler to find the specificed file, read it and place it right here.


<> - The angle brackets

The angle brackets are placed just after the #include command.
This is where you specify the files/libraries you want to have included.


iostream - Input-Output-Stream

iostream is used by cout, which assists with writing to the console. 


main() - Main function

The main function is special as it will start automatically along with your program. Other functions will not do this and will have to be invoked/called by code.

Like any other function, main() must state what kind of value it returns. 
In the example above it will return an integer to the Operating System to indicate it's complete.
In this case it returns the integer value 0, as shown by "Return 0".

Some compilers allows you to declare the main() function to return void. 
This is no longer legal C++ and should be refrained from using this method. 
Instead just have it return int, and then simply return 0 as the last line in main(). 



All functions begin with an {opening brace and end with a closing brace}
Everything between the opening and closing braces is considered part of the function.

The object cout is used to prinmt a message to the screen. 
Objects will be brought up in more detail on Day 6.
'cout' is part of the standard library. 

A library is a collection of pre-made classes available for easy use.
The standard library comes with every compiler that follows the ANSI standard.

Here’s how cout is used: Type the word cout, followed by the output redirection operator (<<). Whatever follows the output redirection operator is written to the console. 
If you want a string of characters written, be certain to enclose them in double quotes (“).

\n tells cout to go to a new line.

endl stands for END Line, and is prefered to be used over \n as it might not be supported on particular OS or platform(s).

\t tells cout to insert a tab character

float tells cout to allow decimals

double tells cout that this is a floating-point value. 
More details on this will be explained on Day 3.


Using std:: in front of every cout and endl quickly becomes tedious. 
You can solve this by telling the compiler that you will be using the standard library cout and endl.
