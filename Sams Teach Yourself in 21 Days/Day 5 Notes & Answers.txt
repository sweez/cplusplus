Day 5 Notes & Answers

Today, you will learn
• What a function is and what its parts are
• How to declare and define functions
• How to pass parameters into functions
• How to return a value from a function

Note 1
{
	What is a function?

	In short terms it is a subprogram that can act on data and return a value. 

	Every C++ program has at least one function, main().
	The main function is automatically called upon when you execute your program.

	main() might call other functions, some of which might call still others.

	Those functions are not part of an object, which is why they are referred to as "global". 
	What that means is that they can be accessed from anywhere within your program. 


	Each function has its own name, and when that name is encountered in your code, the execution of the program branches to the body of that function. 
	
	This process is referred to as calling the function. 

	Once the function is finished, execution resumes on the next line of the calling function.


	A well-designed function performs a single, specific, and easily understood task, identified by the function name. 

	Complicated tasks should be broken down into multiple functions!

	

	Functions come in two varieties: user defined and built-in.

	Built-in are part of the compiler, provided by the manufacturer. 
	User-defined functions are the functions you write yourself.

Note 2
{
	A function can receive values, process it, and then return a value.

	The latter one is called a return value, and the type of return value must be declared.

	Example 1:
	int myFunction();

	Here a function named myFunction is declared and will return an integer value. 

	Example 2:
	int myFunction(int someValue, float someFloat);

	This declaration indicates that myFunction will still return an vinteger, but it will also take two values.
