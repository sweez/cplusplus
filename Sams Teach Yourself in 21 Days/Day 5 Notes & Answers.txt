Day 5 Notes & Answers

Today, you will learn
• What a function is and what its parts are
• How to declare and define functions
• How to pass parameters into functions
• How to return a value from a function

Note 1
{
	What is a function?

	In short terms it is a subprogram that can act on data and return a value. 

	Every C++ program has at least one function, main().
	The main function is automatically called upon when you execute your program.

	main() might call other functions, some of which might call still others.

	Those functions are not part of an object, which is why they are referred to as "global". 
	What that means is that they can be accessed from anywhere within your program. 


	Each function has its own name, and when that name is encountered in your code, the execution of the program branches to the body of that function. 
	
	This process is referred to as calling the function. 

	Once the function is finished, execution resumes on the next line of the calling function.


	A well-designed function performs a single, specific, and easily understood task, identified by the function name. 

	Complicated tasks should be broken down into multiple functions!

	

	Functions come in two varieties: user defined and built-in.

	Built-in are part of the compiler, provided by the manufacturer. 
	User-defined functions are the functions you write yourself.
}

Note 2
{
	A function can receive values, process it, and then return a value.

	The latter one is called a return value, and the type of return value must be declared.

	Example 1:
	int myFunction();

	Here a function named myFunction is declared and will return an integer value. 

	Example 2:
	int myFunction(int someValue, float someFloat);

	This declaration indicates that myFunction will still return an vinteger, but it will also take two values.
}

Note 3
{
	Sending values INTO a function

	When values are sent into a function they will act as variables that can be manipulated within the function. 
	The description of the values you send is called a parameter list.

	In the previous example, the parameter list contains someValue that is a variable of type integer and someFloat that is a variable of type float.


	A parameter describes the type of the value that will be passed into the function when the function is called. 
	The actual values you pass into the function are called the arguments. 

	Example 1:
	{
		int theValueReturned = myFunction(5,6.7);

		//Here is an integer variable named theValueReturned
		//is initialized with the value returned by myFunction
		//and that the values 5 and 6.7 are passed in as arguments.
	}
}

Note 4
{
	Declaring and Defining Functions

	To use functions in your program first requires said function to be declared, and that you also define it. 

	The declaration tells the compiler the name, return type, and parameters of the function. 


	A declaration of a function is called a prototype.

	Three ways exist to declare a function.
	• Write your prototype into a file, and then use the #include directive to include it in your program.
	• Write the prototype into the file in which your function is used.
	• Define the function before it is called by any other function. When you do this, the definition acts as its own prototype. 
}

Note 5
{
	Parts of a function prototype

	unsigned short int 	FindArea 	(int length, int width);
	   return type		  name 			parameters

	int = parameter type
	length & width = parameter name


	{ - Opening Brace

		// Statements

	} - Closing Brace
}

Note 6
{
	It is possible to define a function before using it, and thus avoid the necessity of creating a function prototype, this is not good programming practice for three reasons.

	First, it's bad to require that functions appear in a file in a particular order. Makes it hard to maintain the program when requirements change.

	Second, it is possible that function A() needs to be able to call function B(), but function B() also needs to be able to call function A() under some circumstances. 
	It is not possible to define function A() before you define function B() and also to define function B() before you define function A(), so at least one of them must be declared in any case

	Third, function prototypes are a good and powerful debugging technique. 
	If your prototype declares that your function takes a particular set of parameters or that it returns a particular type of value, and then your function does not match the prototype, the compiler can flag your error instead of waiting for it to show itself when you run the program. 
	This is like double-entry bookkeeping. The prototype and the definition check each other, reducing the likelihood that a simple typo will lead to a bug in your program.
}

Note 7
{
	If your function does not actually return a value, you declare its return type to be void as shown here:
	
	void printNumber( int myNumber);

	This declares a function called printNumber that has one integer parameter. Because void is used as the return time, nothing is returned.
}

Note 8
{
	Determining Variable Scope

	A variable has a scope, which determines how long it is available for in your program.
	Variables declared within a block are scoped to that block; they can be accessed only within that block's braces {}

	Global Scope

	A global scope is available everywhere in your program

	
	Local Scope

	A local scope is only available within the body of a function
	When the function returns, the local variables are no longer available and will be marked for destruction by the compiler.
}

Note 9
{
	Global Variables

	Variables defined outside of any function have global scope, and thus are available from any function in the program, including main().


	Local variables with the same name as global variables will not change the global variables.

	If a function has a variable with the same name as a global variable, the name will refer to the local variable, and not the global one, when used within the function.
}

Note 10
{
	Even though there is no real limits to the size of a function, well-designed functions tend to be small. 

	It's recommended by many programmers, as a rule of thumb, to keep your functions short enough to fit on a single screen so that you can see the entire function at once.

	Each function should carry out a single, easily understood task.
	If it's getting too large, look for places where you can cut it into smaller tasks.
}

Note 11
{
	Overloading functions

	It is possible to create more than one function with the same name.
	For it to work you just simply have to make sure their parameter list is different to each other.

	Example 1:

	int myFunction (int, int);
	int myFunction (long, long);
	int myFunction (long);


	Rather than making this
	Example 2:

	int DoubleInt(int);
	long DoubleLong(long);
	float DoubleFloat(float);
	double DoubleDouble(double);

	You can do this with the help of function overloading:

	int Double(int);
	long Double(long);
	float Double(float);
	double Double(double);

	Which is easier to read and use.
	You don't have to worry about which one to call; you just pass in a variable and the right function is called automatically.
}

Note 12
{
	Recursion

	A function can call itself. This is called recursion.
	It can be either direct or indirect.
	
	It is direct when a function calls itself.
	It is indirect when a function calls another function that then calls the first function.

	
	It is important to note that when a function calls itself, a new copy of that function is run.

	What this means is that the local variables in the second version are independent of the local variables in the first, and they cannot affect one another directly, any more than the local variables in main() can affect the local variables in any function it calls.



	Recursive functions needs a stop condition or it will keep on going forever.
}

Note 13
{
	The main reason as to why you should NOT make all variables global is because it becomes very difficult to find bugs in your program as the data could have been corrupt by any of the functions.

	Global data can be changed anywhere in the program.
}

	Quiz
	{
		+ 1. What are the differences between the function prototype and the function definition?  

		A: A function definiton defines the function body and tells what will happen when the function is called. 

		A function prototype is a declaration/definition that includes the types of the function parameters, which allows the compiler to perform validity checks. It also ends with a semicolon

		

		+ 2. Do the names of parameters have to agree in the prototype, definition, and call to the function?  
		A: No, it's dependent on their position, not name.


		+ 3. If a function doesn’t return a value, how do you declare the function? 
		A: You declare it with void.


		- 4. If you don’t declare a return value, what type of return value is assumed? 
		A: 
		Correction: Any function that does not explicitly declare a return type returns int. You should always declare the return type as a matter of good programming practice.


		+ 5. What is a local variable?ö 
		A: As the name implies, it is a local variable that only exists within a block. 



		+ 6. What is scope? 
		A: A variable has a scope, which determines how long it is available for in your program.


		+ 7. What is recursion? 
		A: It is when you call the same function that you're currently in, or when you're in a function, call another function, and then from there call the first function once again.


		+ 8. When should you use global variables? 
		A: When you need to have some data available to many functions.


		+ 9. What is function overloading? 
		A: It is when you have several functions with the same name.

	Exercises
	{
		+ 1. Write the prototype for a function named Perimeter(), which returns an unsigned long int and takes two parameters, both unsigned short ints. 
		A: 
		{
			unsigned long int Perimeter(unsigned short int, unsigned short int);
		}


		- 2. Write the definition of the function Perimeter() as described in Exercise 1. The two parameters represent the length and width of a rectangle. Have the function return the perimeter (twice the length plus twice the width).
		A: 
		{
			length = x;
			width = y;

			return (length * 2, width * 2)
		}

		{
			length = x * 2;
			width = y * 2;

			return (length + width)

		}
		Correction: 
		
		{
			unsigned long int Perimeter(unsigned short int length, unsigned short int width)
			{
				return (2*length) + (2*width);
			}
		}

		+ 3. BUG BUSTERS: What is wrong with the function in the following code?

		#include <iostream>
		void myFunc(unsigned short int x);
		int main()
		{
			unsigned short int x, y; // X is not initialized anywhere
			y = myFunc(int);
			std::cout << “x: “ << x << “ y: “ << y << “\n”;
			return 0;
		}
		void myFunc(unsigned short int x)
		{
			return (4*x); //Tries to return a value even though the function is set as void
		}
		A: See comments
			


		+ 4. BUG BUSTERS: What is wrong with the function in the following code?
			#include <iostream>
			int myFunc(unsigned short int x);
			int main()
			{
				unsigned short int x, y;
				x = 7;
				y = myFunc(x);
				std::cout << “x: “ << x << “ y: “ << y << “\n”;
				return 0;
			}
			
			int myFunc(unsigned short int x); // Remove the semicolon
			{
				return (4*x);
			}
		



		+ 5. Write a function that takes two unsigned short integer arguments and returns the result of dividing the first by the second. Do not do the division if the second number is zero, but do return –1.
		A: 
		{
			int myFunc(unsigned short int x, unsigned short int y)
			{
				if (y == 0)
				{
					return -1;
				}
				else 
				{
					int result = x/y;
					return result;
				}
			}
		}


		+ 6. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and calls the function you wrote in Exercise 5. Print the answer, or print an error message if you get –1.
		A: 
		{
			#include <iostream>
			using namespace std;

			int myFunc(unsigned short int x, unsigned short int y);

			int main()
			{
				int x, y, result;
				
				cout << "Please enter x: ";
				cin >> x;
				cout << "\nPlease enter y: ";
				cin >> y;

				result = myFunc(x, y);
				cout << result;
			}


			int myFunc(unsigned short int x, unsigned short int y)
			{
				if (y == 0)
				{
					cout << "Error message!\n";
					return -1;
				}
				else
				{
					int result = x / y;
					return result;
				}
}
		}

		? 7. Write a program that asks for a number and a power. Write a recursive function that takes the number to the power. Thus, if the number is 2 and the power is 4, the function will return 16.
		{
			#include <iostream>
			using namespace std;
			int result;

			int recursion(int number, int power);

			int main()
			{
				int number, power;

				cout << "Enter number: ";
				cin >> number;
				cout << "\nEnter power: ";
				cin >> power;
				result = recursion(number, power);
				cout << "The result is: " << result;
			}

			int recursion(int number, int power)
			{
				if (number == 2 && power == 4)
				{
					int result = 16;
					return result;
				}

				else
				{
					cout << "It did not work!" << endl;
				}
			}
					}
