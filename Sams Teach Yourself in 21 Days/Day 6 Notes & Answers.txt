	Introducing Classes and Members

	You can make a new type in C++ by declaring a class.

	A class is a collection of variables - often of different types - combined with a set of related functions.

	One way to see a class is by imagining a car as a collection of wheels, doors, seats, windows, and so forth. 
	Another way to think about what a car can do: it can move, speed up, slow down, stop, park, and so on. 

	A class enables you to encapsulate, or bundle, these various parts and functions into one collection, which is called an object.
